# Introduction to Parallel Computing
**Theory**:  
• Concepts in Parallel Computing.  
• Fundamentals of Parallel Machine Architectures. Interconnection of Networks Topologies for
Parallel Machines.  
• Parallel Computing Models, Simulations among Models, Brent's Scheduling Principle.   
• Parallel Algorithms in a Shared Memory Environment.  
• Introduction to the Message Passing Parallel Computing Model. Parallel Algorithms in a
Distributed Memory Computing Environment.  

**Lab**:
Introduction to parallel distributed memory programming using the Message Passing
Interface (MPI) library.  

During the semester, I had to submit two assignments for a total of 30% of the final grade.

# Assignment 1
Load-balanced vector calculations with non-collective MPI functions
